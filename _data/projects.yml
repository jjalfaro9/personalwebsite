- name: Solar-powered Bright-field Microscope
  description1: Designed and manufactured a durable, inexpensive, solar-powered bright-field microscope to be used in rural Cameroon to&#58; <ul><li style="padding-top:5px;">&rarr;&nbsp;validate a water distribution and filtraton system being installed by Engineers Without Borders. Achieved by checking if e. coli (~5 microns) was present in filtered water.</li><li style="padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:10px;">&rarr;&nbsp;educate women/children about germ theory of disease and hygiene best practices in after school programs.</li></ul> The microscope has been in Ntisaw, Cameroon for well over a year now. You can see pictures <a href="/projects/microscope_pics" target="_blank">here</a>.<div style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">Inexpensivley resolving bacteria at 5 microns was quite a challenge. I'm currently writing a paper documenting the design and building process.</div><div>I'm also seeking other students to help model and print the microscope to speed up the manufacturing time.</div>
